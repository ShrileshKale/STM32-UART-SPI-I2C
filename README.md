# STM32-UART-SPI-I2C communication with Arduino board using HAL APIs

This repository gives an idea about how to use UART/SPI/I2C communication using HAL APIs

For SPI, Pin D10 - CS, D11 - MOSI, D12 - MISO and D13- SCLK were connected to Arduino Uno.

For I2C, Pin D14- SDA and D15- SCL were connected to (A4 and A5) pins of Arduino Uno Wifi Rev 2 board.
